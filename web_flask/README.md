# AirBnB Clone - Web Framework

## Description

This project is part of the larger AirBnB Clone series, focusing on developing a web framework using Flask. In this section, we build upon the existing AirBnB clone to create a dynamic web application. The goal is to integrate Flask into our project, allowing us to create web routes, render HTML templates, and interact with the backend database using SQLAlchemy.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of the Flask web framework.
- Create web routes and handle HTTP requests.
- Render HTML templates using Flask.
- Integrate Flask with SQLAlchemy for database interactions.
- Develop dynamic web applications that interact with a backend database.

## Project Structure

- **0-hello_route.py**: A simple Flask web application that starts a web server and listens on `0.0.0.0`, port `5000`.
- **1-hbnb_route.py**: A Flask web application that sets up routes and renders an HTML template.
- **2-c_route.py**: A Flask web application that sets up a dynamic route with a variable.
- **3-python_route.py**: A Flask web application that sets up a dynamic route with a default variable.
- **4-number_route.py**: A Flask web application that sets up a dynamic route that only accepts integers.
- **5-number_template.py**: A Flask web application that renders a template if a number is passed in the URL.
- **6-number_odd_or_even.py**: A Flask web application that renders a template with additional logic to check if a number is odd or even.
- **7-states_list.py**: A Flask web application that fetches data from a storage engine and renders it in a template.
- **8-cities_by_states.py**: A Flask web application that fetches and displays cities by states.
- **9-states.py**: A Flask web application that fetches and displays states with additional functionalities.
- **10-hbnb_filters.py**: A Flask web application that fetches data and renders it in a template with filters.
- **100-hbnb.py**: A Flask web application that fetches data and renders the entire AirBnB clone website.

## How to Start It

To start any of the Flask applications, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Flask installed. If not, you can install Flask using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
